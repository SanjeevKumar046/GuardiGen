      <h2>Passwords are dead!</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to GuardiGen, where we cook up passwords so strong, even the
        internet's jealous! Just give us the website name, your username, and a
        top-secret key, and voila! You'll have a password that's as unique as
        your fingerprint (well, almost). And hey, no worries about us snooping
        around—we keep it all offline and under lock and key on your device.
        Lose your password? No problemo! Just swing by here, punch in the deets,
        and bam! Your password's back like it never left. Who needs those stuffy
        password managers or Wi-Fi anyway?
      </p>
      <div id="spacer"></div>
      <div id="spacer"></div>
      <h2>But Why ?</h2>
      <h4>- Unique</h4>
      <p>
        Ever reused a password like it's your favorite pair of socks? Well,
        GaurdiGen knows that's risky business. With just one secret key to
        remember, GaurdiGen creates different passwords for each of your
        accounts. Because let's face it, one-size-fits-all doesn't work for
        passwords or socks.
      </p>
      <h4>- Strength</h4>
      <p>
        Did you know, more than 86% of people use passwords that could be
        cracked faster than you can say "password@123"? GaurdiGen tackles this
        head-on with super strong passwords that can withstand the mightiest of
        cyber attacks. No more sitting ducks here!
      </p>
      <h4>- Unforgettable</h4>
      <p>
        GaurdiGen makes forgetting your password a thing of the past. Each
        password is uniquely crafted based on your account details. Forget it?
        No worries! Just regenerate it using the same secret key. Just remember,
        keep that secret key… well, a secret!
      </p>
      <h4>- Trust</h4>
      <p>
        GaurdiGen isn't just another app - it's 100% free and open source. It
        uses top-notch security algorithms to generate your passwords and
        ensures every line of code you see is what runs on your device. Your
        data stays yours—offline and secure, just like hiding your secret candy
        stash from your siblings.
      </p>
      <div id="spacer"></div>
      <div id="spacer"></div>
      <h2>The Key is the Key!</h2>
      <p>
        Your secret key is as unique as your fingerprint. Choose one that even
        Sherlock Holmes couldn't crack. Throw in some symbols, uppercase
        letters, and numbers for that extra oomph against hackers.
      </p>
      <p>
        GuardiGen plays referee—it'll let you know if your secret key is a
        touchdown or needs a pep talk. Remember, keep your secret key under
        wraps. Sharing it is like handing out your passwords on a silver
        platter. Stick with your chosen secret key each time you whip up a new
        password. If you're prone to forgetting, a password manager can babysit
        all your secret keys like a pro.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, think of something like <code>SecretSauce#123!</code> or
        <code>FortKnox$Secure&789</code>. They're tougher to crack than a
        triple-locked breif-case.

                Many people use very weak passwords that are easily hacked in
                the event of a data breach.
              </p>
              <p>
                Using the same password across multiple accounts is risky; if
                one account is hacked, all linked accounts become
                vulnerable.Remembering different passwords for various accounts
                can be challenging and prone to forgetfulness.
              </p>
              <p>
                GuardiGen addresses all these issues effectively, improving
                password security without adding complexity to the password
                creation process.

              ><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>
                GuardiGen generates a robust password based on your input. This
                password remains consistent as long as your input remains
                unchanged.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, by altering even a single variable such as the website
                or username, the password automatically changes, ensuring each
                of your accounts has a unique password.
              </p>
              <p>
                Moreover, you can easily generate a different password for the
                same account later. Simply modify your secret key or append a
                number to your username to create another entirely distinct
                password.
              </p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>
                GuardiGen always creates the same password for the same input,
                which can be a problem if there's a rare data breach. When using
                hashed passwords like this, changing your secret key and making
                a new GuardiGen is the only solution. This means you might have
                to remember two different secret keys. It's not ideal and can be
                bothersome, but you won't need to do it often. Even if hackers
                get your password hash, it would take them many years to crack
                it using brute force.
              </p>

          </div>
          <div class="accordion-item">
            <button id="accordion-button-4" aria-expanded="false">
              <span class="accordion-title"
                >What if someone finds out my secret key?</span
              ><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>
                If you follow the instructions for entering your secret key,
                it's almost impossible for a hacker to use brute force to guess
                it. I have to admit, though, there's still a slight chance. But
                to succeed, they'd need a lot of supercomputers—so many that not
                even the military could help them.
              </p>
              <p>
                GuardiGen uses the Scrypt + SHA3 algorithm to create passwords,
                which shields you from brute force attacks by specialized
                hardware called ASICs. These devices are incredibly pricey. Even
                if someone built one just for GuardiGen, it would cost thousands
                of dollars and require a leaked copy of your account database.
                Even then, cracking your secret key would be unlikely for many
                years.
              </p>
              <p>
                If your secret key is strong, there's no need to worry. I'm
                confident because I use GuardiGen myself with a strong secret
                key, which protects me from hackers. Hopefully, yours is just as
                secure whenever GuardiGen gives the green light.

              <p>
                No, not at all. Password managers need a database and usually
                rely on the internet for syncing and storing multiple passwords
                across websites.
              </p>

              <p>
                GuardiGen, on the other hand, generates hashed passwords without
                storing them in a database. It calculates passwords based on the
                information you input, like solving a math problem: <br /><br />
                <code>Website + Username + Secret = Password</code>
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>You should use <strong>GuardiGen</strong> if:</li>
                <li>- You use the same password everywhere.</li>
                <li>- You often forget passwords.</li>
                <li>- You're not familiar with using a password manager.</li>
                <li>- You prefer not to use a password manager.</li>
                <li>
                  - You want access to your passwords even without internet or
                  access to a password manager.
                </li>
                <li>
                  - You don't want to spend time creating strong passwords for
                  each account individually.
                </li>
                <li>
                  - You want your computer to handle password management with
                  minimal upkeep.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                You don't need GuardiGen if you always have your password
                manager database accessible, use strong and unique passwords for
                every account, or always have internet access and multi-device
                syncing. You can also use GuardiGen alongside a password
                manager. This way, your password manager can store different
                secret keys for added security in case of a database breach.
                It's like having double protection.
